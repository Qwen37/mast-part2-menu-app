   - See total count and average prices
   - Navigate to Add Menu or Filter screens

2. **Add Menu Screen** 
   - Add new dishes with validation
   - Select course using Picker
   - Price validation (numeric only)

3. **Filter Screen**
   - Filter dishes by course
   - View filtered results
   - Toggle between All/Starter/Main/Dessert

## Testing Notes

During development, I tested:

### ✅ **Adding Dishes**
- Made sure all fields are required and show error messages if empty
- Price field only accepts numbers - spent some time getting this validation right
- Course dropdown works smoothly
- Form clears after adding a dish successfully

### ✅ **Home Screen Display**
- FlatList shows all dishes properly 
- Total count updates when I add new items
- Average price calculations work correctly - had to debug this a few times
- Empty state shows helpful message when no dishes added yet

### ✅ **Navigation**
- All buttons navigate to correct screens
- Back button works as expected
- Smooth transitions between screens

### ✅ **Filtering**
- Filter buttons highlight when selected
- Shows correct number of items for each course
- "All" option displays everything

### ✅ **Input Validation**
- Tested with empty inputs - proper error messages show
- Tried entering text in price field - validation catches it
- All alert messages display correctly

## Challenges I Faced

- Getting the average price calculation working took some trial and error
- Had to figure out the proper way to import screens (ended up using barrel exports)
- Spent time on making the UI look professional and consistent
- TypeScript errors needed some debugging initially

## What I Learned

This project helped me understand:
- React Navigation setup and usage
- useState for managing app state
- FlatList for rendering lists efficiently  
- Form validation and user feedback
- Professional UI design principles

## Peer Feedback Incorporated

*"Hey, I tried your app and it works really well! The design looks clean and professional. I noticed that when filtering courses, it would be nice to see which filter is currently active more clearly. Maybe a different color for the selected button?"*

*Response: Thanks for the feedback! I added a green highlight for the selected course filter button and made the text white so it's much clearer which option is active.*
